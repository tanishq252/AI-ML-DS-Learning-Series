# AI-ML-DS-Learning-Series

After completion of ML course from Stanford University I thought of exploring the algorithms and making models in python. This repo consists of all the basic models of algoeithms that I have encountered in my AI journey.
This repo consists of : 
- *REGRESSION*
- - Simple Linear Regression
- - Multiple Linear Regression
- - Polynomial Linear Regression
- - Support Vector Regression
- - Decision Tree Regression
- - Random Forest Regression
