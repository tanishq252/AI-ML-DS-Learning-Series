# AI-ML-DS-Learning-Series ðŸ¤–

After completion of ML course from Stanford University I thought of exploring more ML algorithms and making models in python using inbuilt libraries. This repo consists of all the basic models of algorithms that I have encountered in my AI journey.

  - Random Forest Regression
 
- **CLASSIFICATION**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine(Linear and Non-linear)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
  - XGBoost
 
- **CLUSTERING**
  - Heirarchical 
  - K Means
 
- **ASSOCIATION LEARNING**
  - Apriori
  - Eclat

- **REINFORCEMENT LEARNING**
  - Upper Confidence Bound
